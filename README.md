For the most up-to-date installation notes, please also see [the documentation](https://www.vianetz.com/en/install-magento-extension/).

1. Do a backup of your Magento installation for safety reasons.
2. Disable Magento compilation feature (if activated): _System > Tools > Compiler_
3. Unzip the setup package and copy the contents of the `src/` folder into the Magento root folder. (The folder structure
   is the same as in your Magento installation. No files will be overwritten.)
   Please assure that the files are uploaded with the same file user permissions as the Magento installation!
4. Clear the Magento cache (and related caches like APC if available)
5. Logout from the admin panel and then login again
6. Enable the Magento compilation feature (if it was activated before): _System > Tools > Compiler_

As an alternative, I recommend installing the Extension via composer:
